# knolx_ansible_demo

This is the small demo project for basic understanding of Ansible.
It will give understanding of basic concepts of Ansible such as Playbook, Inventory, Roles, Module etc.

In this demo we will try to configure 2 hosts using Ansible. First we will try to install a webserver on both hosts, then we try to copy a basic html file to both hosts and then we will start the webserver and will try to render that html file using browser.

In the second task we will try to configure the iptables of both hosts.
